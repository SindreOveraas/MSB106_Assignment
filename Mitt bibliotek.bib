Given that young women now match or surpass men's educational achievements on many measures, how do they fare in terms of equal earnings? Would further educational changes matter for closing any existing gap? Analyzing data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey, the author found that college-educated men in their mid-20s already earn, on average, about \$7,000 more per year than do college-educated women. The findings suggest that this gap would still be substantial?about \$4,400 per year?if women and men had similar educational credentials, scores on standardized tests, fields of study, and degrees from colleges of similar selectivity. Although women's gains in education may have been central to narrowing the gender gap in income historically, gender differences in fields of study continue to disadvantage women. Moreover, gender differences in work-related factors are more important than are educational differences for understanding contemporary income inequality among young workers.},

  abstract = {Empirical evidence has shown that married men generally earn more and married women earn less than their unmarried counterparts. However, the control group of ?not married? differs between studies, over time and between countries, such that the message remains somewhat fuzzy. It is not clear whether the type of union or the fact of being in a union is responsible for these wage penalties and premiums. This article aims to analyze whether marriage pays more than cohabitation in a country such as France, where cohabiting and married partnerships have both coexisted for years. Thanks to a rich dataset with information on both the marital and work history of both partners, we are able to estimate the effect on hourly wages of being married relative to being in a cohabiting union. Taking into account selections into marriage (rather than cohabitation) and into the labor market with a possible differential in sharing of paid work within the couple, our results show that the men?s marriage premium is due entirely to a positive selection into marriage. While the process of within-couple marital specialization strongly reduces a woman?s hourly wage, there is no evidence of any additional marriage penalty for women. The within-couple gender wage gap is similar for married and cohabiting partners, after controlling for selection into marriage.},

  abstract = {Design Thinking (DT) is advocated as a user-centred approach to innovation, based on the way designers think and work. Despite being increasingly promoted as an approach to innovation, there is still little evidence of successful impact. Rather, indications suggest that firms find implementation challenging. The purpose of this paper is to analyse challenges of using DT in light of literature on innovation barriers, in order to discuss whether there is something unique about DT as a concept that makes it particularly challenging to use. The paper is based on an interview study of five large firms that all have at least five years of experience of using DT. The analysis shows that several of the perceived challenges can be linked to known barriers to innovation. However, other challenges have not previously been described in the innovation literature, and the paper suggests that there are some unique aspects of DT that makes it particularly challenging for firms to integrate it in innovation work. These are related to its core themes: user focus, problem framing, experimentation, visualization and diversity. Additionally, the paper contributes with an empirically based categorization of challenges that managers will find useful if they want to implement design thinking in their organizations.},

  abstract = {Following a peak in 2008, the value of gross domestic product (GDP) per inhabitant in purchasing power standard (PPS) of EU regions generally fell in 2009 because of the crisis. However, GDP per inhabitant has subsequently risen albeit at a varying pace across EU regions as regional economies have recovered. In approximately half of 280 EU NUTS level 2 regions, GDP per capita had returned to or rose above its 2008 level within two years. For further 111, GDP per inhabitant remained below its 2008 level for between three and eight years.   The source dataset is accessible here.   More generally, in most regions in the north, west and east of the EU, GDP per inhabitant had stayed above or returned above their 2008 level by 2013 at the latest; with the exceptions of: much of Finland and several regions in Sweden among the northern EU Member States; several regions in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom among the western Member States; all regions of Croatia and Slovenia, and a few regions of Czechia among the eastern Member States. The main concentration of regions whose GDP per inhabitant was still below its 2008 level by 2014 was in the southern EU Member States of Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal; with the exceptions of: Malta (one region at this level of detail); four Italian regions — Valle d’Aosta/Vallée d’Aoste, Abruzzo, Puglia and the Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano/Bozen; and three Portuguese regions — Norte, Centro and the Região Autónoma dos Açores.   Bucking the trend It is worth noting that in 10 regions, GDP per inhabitant rose rather than fell in 2009.  Six of these regions were in Poland, two in France (Corsica, Guyane) and one each in Greece (Dytiki Makedonia) and Finland (Åland). Most of these 10 regions experienced an uninterrupted increase in their GDP per inhabitant despite the crisis. This  was the case in Corsica (France) and the six Polish regions. The other three regions — Dytiki Makedonia (Greece), Guyane (France) and Åland (Finland) — recorded a fall one year later. In other words, their GDP per inhabitant peaked in 2009 rather than in 2008.   Are you interested in further information on regional socioeconomic developments? You can find it in the dedicated chapter of the Eurostat regional yearbook 2019. This chapter uses key indicators from a variety of datasets to analyse socioeconomic developments within the EU from 2008 — when the global financial and economic crisis was first felt in the EU — through to the latest period available.

With this severe drop in aggregate demand and output, employment decreased by around 100,000 between 2008 and 2009 (a decreased employment rate of 2.1 percentage units), while the unemployment rate increased from 6.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent of the labour force. The fall in output and employment was particularly marked in manufacturing and construction, with decreases of 14 per cent and 6 per cent of employment respectively (Statistics Sweden). With regard to Swedish manufacturing, the fall in employment was particularly marked in export-oriented industries. Due to the sharp increase of unemployment, local plant closure and the overall reduction of economic growth, the recession led to a reduction of tax revenues for local authorities that are responsible for the provision of social services, health and education. In a first phase, this situation led to severe budget cuts at the local level and decline in public employment, mainly among public employees on short-term contracts.},

Although traditional human capital variables and structural labor market variables explain part of the income gap, family context variables explain much and call attention to the importance of the work-family interface in studies of physician income. Despite similar human capital investments and labor market locations, women married to physicians tend to do family, and men married to physicians tend to do career.

Design/methodology/approach The study is based on literature review. To explore progress and future needs of open innovation studies, various contributory papers have been consulted and analyzed. Findings Definition of open innovation is yet to be clear‐cut. What open innovation is and what it is not, is still being debated. Moreover, open innovation overlaps other concepts such as user generation, crowdsourcing, and distributed innovation. Even though research on open innovation has significantly grown, there are still many issues that need to be addressed to get insight about open innovation in various contexts. Studies are mostly performed in the context of large firms and in developed countries. Research in the context of developing countries is still almost an untouched area. Open innovation in the small to medium‐sized enterprises’ (SMEs’) context has gained a foothold just recently. It is crucial to explore some managerial challenges, such as technology transfer, inbound and outbound process, absorptive and desorptive capacity development, particularly in the global open innovation context and it is essential to investigate how open innovation can be implemented for sustainable development. Originality/value This study is one of the few, if not only one, that has reviewed the trend of open innovation research and its practical implementation.

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that men’s wages rise more rapidly than expected prior to marriage, but interpretations diverge on whether this indicates selection or a causal effect of anticipating marriage. We seek to adjudicate this debate by bringing together literatures on (1) the male marriage wage premium; (2) selection into marriage based on men’s economic circumstances; and (3) the transition to adulthood, during which both union formation and unusually rapid improvements in work outcomes often occur. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we evaluate these perspectives. We show that wage declines predate rather than follow divorce, indicating no evidence that staying married benefits men’s wages. We find that older grooms experience no unusual wage patterns at marriage, suggesting that the observed marriage premium may simply reflect co-occurrence with the transition to adulthood for younger grooms. We show that men entering shotgun marriages experience similar premarital wage gains as other grooms, casting doubt on the claim that anticipation of marriage drives wage increases. We conclude that the observed wage patterns are most consistent with men marrying when their wages are already rising more rapidly than expected and divorcing when their wages are already falling, with no additional causal effect of marriage on wages.},

  abstract = {Purpose The objectives of this study are threefold: firstly, to measure the impact of educational inequality on income inequality, and per capita income; secondly, to measure the impact of gender inequality in education on income inequality, per capita income and educational inequality; and lastly, to test the Kuznets inverted U-shape hypothesis between inequality in education and average year of schooling. Design/methodology/approach The study has adopted the Marin and Psacharopoulos (1976) model of human capital in which income earned by an individual can be estimated as a function of number of year spent in schooling or education. Gini coefficient is used as a measure of income inequality, while inequality in education is measured by Gini index of educational inequality. Gender inequality in education is measured by the difference between male and female enrolment ratios as a proportion of male enrolment. The study utilizes the data of six South Asian countries, i.e. Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka from 1980 to 2010 at five-year average and employs fixed effect model (FEM) and random effect model (REM) for estimation. Findings Result suggests that educational inequality and average year of schooling have positive and significant impact on income inequality. Primary (basic) education and tertiary (higher) education reduce income inequality, while secondary education widens income inequality. Negative relationship exists between educational inequality and per capita income. Unequal distribution of education among boys and girls at primary level increases income inequality, while reduces income inequality at tertiary level. Gender inequality in secondary and tertiary level of education reduces per capita income, while unequal distribution of education among boys and girls further increases the educational inequality. Kuznets inverted U-shape hypothesis does not hold between education expansion and educational inequality, while weak U-shape relationship exists in South Asian countries. Practical implications Government has to provide free education in poor regions and makes employment programs to reduce the income and educational inequality respectively, while to remove gender inequality in education it is necessary to build more schools especially for girls. Government has to launch different online education programs for expansion in education at all levels. Originality/value This study adds to the literature by analyzing whether the inequality in income increases (decreases) due to increase (decrease) in educational and gender inequality in South Asian countries. This study contributes in the existing literature by developing a measure of educational and gender inequality in education in South Asian countries.

In 2016—the most recent year for which data are available—more than 2,295,000 scientific and engineering research articles were published worldwide (National Science Foundation, 2018e). In addition, the number of scientific and engineering fields and subfields of research is large and has greatly expanded in recent years, especially in fields that intersect disciplines (e.g., biophysics); more than 230 distinct fields and subfields can now be identified. The published literature is so voluminous and specialized that some researchers look to information retrieval, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to track and apprehend the important work in their own fields.},

A key assumption is that marital status proxies for the consumption of family goods - such as children; and that these are costly. Workers whose greater demands for family goods are taste-generated are shown to choose jobs that offer greater wage, and lesser nonpecuniary compensation. This creates an observed wage premium that has nothing to do with differences in workers' productivities. Supporting empirical evidence for this hypothesis is presented, including a reevaluation of previous studies.},
