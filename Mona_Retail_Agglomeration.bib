We distinguish three types of micro-foundations, based on sharing, matching, and learning mechanisms. For each of these three categories, we develop one or more core models in detail and discuss the literature in relation to those models. This allows us to give a precise characterisation of some of the main theoretical underpinnings of urban agglomeration economies, to discuss modelling issues that arise when working with these tools, and to compare different sources of agglomeration economies in terms of the aggregate urban outcomes they produce as well as in terms of their normative implications.},

The aims of ESDA are described and a simple data model is defined associating the elements of ‘rough’ and ‘smooth’ with different attribute properties. The distinction is drawn between global and local statistics. SAGE's region building and adjacency matrix modules are described. These allow the user to evaluate the sensitivity of results to the choice of areal partition and measure of interarea adjacency. A range of ESDA techniques are described and examples given. The interaction between the table, map and graph drawing windows in SAGE is illustrated together with the range of data queries that can be implemented based on attribute values and locational criteria. The paper concludes with a brief assessment of the contribution of SAGE to the development of spatial data analysis.},

  abstract = {Spatial data analysis is a rapidly growing area in Statistics. Such data are taken here to be defined on objects in space, which objects have physical location. The analyses are spatial if these locations are relevant to the interpretation of the data. Invariably the examination of the data involves the examination of some form of map; often it will involve little more. Graphical techniques for examining such maps are thus a central part of the methodology. A number of such techniques are discussed. Developments in information technology are a driving force in spatial data analysis. These include automatic data capture (as in remote sensing), image processing hardware, geographical information systems and dynamically linked windows. These technologies will have a profound influence on the types of spatial analyses in which statisticians are becoming involved. In particular, studies involving the integration of data, perhaps of quite different type, will become more common, arising for example from international collaboration in environmental monitoring. The inter-relationships between diverse types of data can be complex. The spatial decomposition of these relationships is a vital part of the integration. The data are frequently observational and often multivariate. The analyses are often exploratory. Linking a number of different but relatively simple views of the data can be productive. Such views can be associated with models. The paper (and a companion paper, Bradley \& Haslett (1992)) illustrate this by reference to ideas from geostatistical models. Pointwise and pairwise decompositions are introduced.},

  abstract = {Purpose The Norwegian retail market for alcoholic beverages is controlled by a state monopoly. Wine and other alcoholic beverages above 4.75 per cent alcohol, can only be bought in government stores called The Wine Monopoly (Vinmonopolet in Norwegian) or consumed in hotels, restaurants, bars, pubs, or catering firms. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the Norwegian wine market and present some of the major opportunities and constraints facing foreign producers. Design/methodology/approach The objective of this article is twofold: first, to explain the role of the actors in the Norwegian wine market and second, to identify the market opportunities for Italian and other foreign producers. The organisation of the monopoly, the strategies wine producers may use to introduce new wines into the market, and the marketing levers that can be used to utilise the market opportunities are of special interest. The key informant techniques as well as official statistics are used. Findings Comparing the outcome of the authors' field research, done during the winter of 2010, with government statistics on wine consumption, it is clear that the competitive environment evolves daily. Consumers' tastes and perceptions play a crucial role in this dynamism. Originality/value There have not been many studies of the effects of the alcohol monopoly on the Norwegian market. Therefore, it is of particular interest to investigate the organisation of the Norwegian alcohol monopoly and how wine producers may successfully introduce new wines into this market. This paper makes a positive contribution to the literature in this field, giving some promotion strategies which could be achievable and could work in the Norwegian wine market.}

  abstract = {This paper examines the factors determining the subnational geographic location of the investments of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Building on the tension between the costs and benefits that agglomeration confers on firms, we compare and contrast Marshallian and Jacobian agglomeration mechanisms to understand the micro-location patterns of domestic and foreign firms. We test these ideas on a dataset of 387.000 workplace-year observations located across 93 municipalities in Denmark. The results show that while agglomeration is systematically related to both foreign and domestic location patterns, some of these relationships vary across agglomeration types and across subsamples of domestic and foreign workplaces. We also demonstrate the importance of controlling for global connectivity, which may otherwise confound these relationships.},

  abstract = {Firms and workers are much more productive in large and dense urban environments. There is substantial evidence of such agglomeration economies based on three approaches. First, on a clustering of production beyond what can be explained by chance or comparative advantage. Second, on spatial patterns in wages and rents. Third, on systematic variations in productivity with the urban environment. However, more needs to be learned about the causes of agglomeration economies. We have good models of agglomeration through sharing and matching, but not a deep enough understanding of learning in cities. Despite recent progress, more work is needed to distinguish empirically between alternative causes.},
