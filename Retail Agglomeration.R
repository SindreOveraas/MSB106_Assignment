Theoretical Framework

**Central place Theory**

**Retail Agglomeration and Economies of Shopping Centres**

Town and cities have long had shopping districts in which stores are concentrated.
To some extent such centre points were the result of uncoordinated store-location decisions (Brueckner, 2011).
Nevertheless, not coincidentally as the concentration of retail stores can be explained by a market desire to create a Nash equilibrium.
At this point all retailers expected outcome cannot be improved by changing position (Hotelling 1929).
Contradictory to the assumption that consumers will shop at the nearest retailer, they are willing to travel significantly further to reach certain central places.
Shopping malls are often located
outside the city centre.
Sometimes they challenge the existence of the city centre.
In extraordinary circumstances they can be seeds for new urban centres.
Not so hard to understand taken into consideration that shopping malls provide most goods and services given downtown.
Not to mention, the convenience of free parking, longer opening hours and easy road access.
Especially, if the malls
cater for cinemas, restaurants, bars and other attributes in conjunction with downtown.
Occasionally, perceived as \"predatory malls\" which are purposely built to take over the local retail market.
Owners of shopping malls \"orchestrate\" the process of retail agglomeration that happens naturally in towns and cities (Brueckner, 2011).
The agglomeration in centre points contributes several benefits for the consumers.
First of all, they save time and money.
When the consumers visit multiple stores to make a variety of purchases, the cost of the overall shopping trip is subsequently reduced (Brueckner, 2011).
Secondly, comparison shopping as consumers prefer to compare products to achieve a better purchase decision. 
Again, resulting in clusters in order to achieve higher shopping benefits than isolated stores.
Consequently, leading to more customer traffic and increased price competition between stores selling
similar products (Brueckner, 2011).
The fact that owners of stores seem to prefer highly concentrated shopping areas suggests that the beneficials outweigh the loss attributable in terms of greater price competition.
\"The benefits of agglomeration can be viewed as arising from inter-store externalities\" (Brueckner, 2011).
For example, shoppers visiting the Winemonopoly in a mall may also visit a clothing store, and even find it beneficial to use public services at the same time.
Anchor-stores such as the Winemonopoly which are few and far in between due to regulation by the governments, bring in a
higher volume of customers.
They can also be used as a tool in rare cases such as prevention of the death of city centre.
When retail agglomeration is orchestrated by the owner of a shopping mall, the strength and the direction of such externalities are taken into account (Brueckner, 2011).
Much so, because the price of rent is dependent on the overall revenue of a shopping mall.
Hence, the owner of the mall will want to choose the mix of stores and their sizes taking these externalities, attributes and anchor stores attractiveness into account (Brueckner, 2011).

**The bid-rent model**

The bid rent model was first introduced by the German social economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen in 1826.
It was initially used as an agricultural model to measure how much land is employed in productive activities, and how land can be allocated between competing users (McCann, 2013). 
The bid-rent model has since been associated with the works of Alsonso (1964,1971).
Further development has been implemented by authors such as Mills (1969, 1970), Muth (1969), and Evans (1973).
Ensuing the model can be applied in a broader setting than the original Thunen model (McCann, 2013). 

**The Bid-rent model**

The bid rent model is a simple theory to explain urban structure.
In order to construct the model, the following assumptions are taken into account.

-   A uniformed space where all land is equally fertile, and transport is identical in all directions.

-   A single, specific marketplace

-   Demand is unlimited; the model is supply-orientated.

-   The production factors are perfectly distributed in space, not uneven spatial distribution.

-   A specific production function with fixed coefficients and constant returns to scale

-   Perfect competition exists in agricultural goods market.

-   Unit transport costs are constant in space: total transport cost depends on:

    A\) The distance between the production site and the town

    B\) The volume of production

**The bid-rent model for a firm**

The adopted bid-rent model includes one major difference, whereas the original model the land and non-land production factors relationships are fixes, land and non-land production factors are assumed to be mutually substitutable inputs, irrespective of whether the firm produces agriculture or a manufactured good (McCann, 2013).

Rent obtained in the model is the remainder left after transport, production costs and profit has been subtracted from revenues.
The rent gradient is a negatively sloped straight line and has an intercept with the vertical axis of maximum value of rent.
Furthermore, it has an intercept with the horizontal axis whereas land value is nil.
The slope is reflecting a trade-off between transport cost and rent.
The llustration shows three categories: retail-, manufacturing- and residential units, each serving a specific purpose.
The rent realized by the landowner is the envelope of the three rent supply curves.

**Analysis**

A more central location implies a willingness to pay higher rents due to lower transport costs and higher revenues.
Likewise, a suburban location yields the same profit if and only if less rent is paid for land.

Furthermore, the saving on land cost must offset the higher transport costs and the lower revenues.
At one unit of distance further away from the centre, the rent offered to maintain the same level of profit, diminishes because of increased transport cost and decreased revenues.
